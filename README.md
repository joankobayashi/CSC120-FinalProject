# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered) >>We discussed about having the waiter freely walk around all of the tables and deal with the customers but we decided that we would have one line of tables since it would be too complicated to do on top of what we already have.
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
    - We first decided on our theme and setting of the game, then figured out what classes and methods we could have, made a shared document with all of them listed (with comments so that we all know), divided up the main classes, coded on our own (and together), and made more edits to polish them up.
 
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn/figure out in completing this project?
    - I learned that having the shared document (we called it the master doc) and having it updated frequently really helped us because we would know the names of the parameters that another person was using. We did have some merge conflicts because we allowed ourselves to edit others’ classes if needed, so in those cases, we gathered (or contacted each other) and picked which one should be kept. I also learned how important it is to have the doc strings. When we have hundreds of lines, all I look for reference were the green words and they helped reduce time to find a certain code.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
    - I wish there was a better way of showing the menu to the player (maybe using graphics) but that wasn’t the priority so it was not cared for.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
    - I would want the waiter to be able to walk to certain tables and take orders. I would also want the restaurant to have more rooms that the waiter can travel around, such as the staff room, the restroom, and maybe the manager’s room to get hired/fired. Also, it would be nice to have pictures of the food because they are foods from our countries (we are all international students.)

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
    - I was figuring out how to randomize the keys in a Hashtable in a certain way, and it was really helpful when one of my teammates said we could just make it an Arraylist by removing the values. It is always nice to step back (or have someone who is not stuck in the mug) and have a fresh perspective.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
    - In terms of teamwork, think well about who you’re teaming up with! It turned out really fun because I could trust my teammates (most of them I already was friends with.) Teamwork decides whether the project becomes super happy or super dreadful. Also, be steady about all of the ambitions you have about the game; start with simple, basic, and then when that works, add on fancy elements and more complicated codes. That will make your life easier.

 - *If you worked with a team:* please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
    - We were really intentional about communicating well and dividing up the work well. Some of us had more coding to do, so others (including me) took on other jobs such as revising the architectural diagram and writing the cheatsheet to balance it out. We first took time getting to know each other (typical move for good teamwork) and found out that we all came outside of the US, which I believe created this passion towards implementing food elements and certain parts of the game such as greeting the customers properly. We were never rude to each other and asked questions when we were confused. I had a great time working with Nadya Negin and Rehab and I want to thank them.
